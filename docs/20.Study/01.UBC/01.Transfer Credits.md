Recently, I looked into the specific requirements for UBC transfer credits, which can be broken down into the following three categories:

- **Faculty-unassigned credits**, such as ARTS<sup>3rd</sup> Year (i.e., a third-year credit in the Faculty of Arts).
- **Department-unassigned credits** that also meet a certain (general) requirement, for example, a third-year Computer Science credit.
  - **Tip**: Compared to the first point, the scope of a department is narrower.
- **Transfer credits for a specific course**, which have the strictest requirements. To qualify as transferable, the course must have at least an 80% overlap with a specific UBC course. You can check UBC’s transfer credit website for a list of approved transfer courses from the past five years at the link below:
